# ItemRecord
This C++ program uses polymorphism. First we create a parent class "ItemRecord" and derive two subclasses called "BookRecord" and "CDRecord". Then from main we create two objects from each subclasses and store them in the ItemRecord pointer array. Then we test different functions like to_string() to test which class function it is calling. It is a example of a run-time polymorphism.
